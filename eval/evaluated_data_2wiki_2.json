However, given that her mother, Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera, was a significant Byzantine figure during the late 12th and early 13th centuries, it is reasonable to infer that she likely had siblings who were also part of the Byzantine nobility.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Historical Context**: Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera was a daughter of Alexios III Angelos, who ruled as Byzantine Emperor from 1195 to 1203. Given the status of her father, it is likely that she came from an extended family with multiple siblings.\n- **General Knowledge**: Many historical figures from this period often had large, interconnected noble families. Therefore, while we cannot provide specific names without additional data, it is reasonable to assume that Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera had siblings who were also influential in Byzantine society.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the exact identities of Eudokia Angelina's mother's siblings are not known based on the provided information, they likely included other members of the Byzantine nobility. For a more precise answer, additional historical records or sources would be necessary to identify specific names and relationships. Thus, we can infer that Eudokia Angelina had uncles who were also part of the Byzantine nobility, but their exact identities remain unknown based on the current information.",
